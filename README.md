# Transformer-From-Scratch
This is a replication of Andrej Karpathy's GPT from scratch, but with a different dataset. Andrej used Tiny Shakespeare, a .txt file containing around 40000 lines from a variety of his most famous plays. 
I have created a .txt file which contains the entire novels of Alice in Wonderland, Lolita & Moby Dick. I have randomly selected these three novels to see what response the transformer generates after being trained on three different types of genres and tones of text.
The .txt file is named as Novels.txt
